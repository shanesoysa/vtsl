                            <p>Anuradhapura is one of the ancient cities in Sri Lanka, well known for its ruins depicting early Sri Lankan civilization. It is very famous among Buddhists pilgrims. Anuradhapura was earlier the capital of the Island (in ancient
                                times) and most of the Kings who ruled Sri Lanka resided in this vast city. On the contrary to the historical data that indicates that the city is founded in the 5 century BC archeological data puts that date back to far
                                as the 10 century BC. However it was King Pandukabhaya who planned the layout of the city and made it his capital in the 4th century BC. He constructed many reservoirs and shrines. The city reached its highest magnificence
                                by the beginning of the Christian era. The city boasted some of the most complex irrigation systems in the ancient world. The city is now named as a world heritage site by UNESCO.</p>

                                from the Sinhalese name Kola-amba-thota which means "Harbour with leafy mango trees". Due to its large harbour and its strategic position along the East-West sea trade routes, Colombo was known to ancient traders 2,000
                                years ago. However it was only made the capital of the island when Sri Lanka was ceded to the British Empire in 1815, and its status as capital was retained when the nation became independent in 1948. In 1978, when administrative
                                functions were moved to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, Colombo was designated as the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.</p>
