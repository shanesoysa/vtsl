                                the Indian Ocean, south of India. The Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th
                                century BC, probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced beginning in about the
                                mid-3rd century BC, and a great civilization developed at such cities as Anuradhapura
                                (kingdom from c.200 BC to c.1000 AD) and Polonnaruwa (c.1070 to 1200). Other notable but
                                relatively more recent kingdoms are Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, Gampola, Kandy and Jaffna
                                Kingdoms.</p>

                                1802. As Ceylon, it became independent in 1948; the name was changed to Sri Lanka in

                                Firstly it is an authentic tourism destination. Secondly it is a compact island of
                                65,610 sqkm where a tourist can travel the length and breadth of the country within a
                                few days, thirdly the diversity of the tourism product is unparalleled.</p>

                                of Sri Lanka in 2010 the tourism authorities started positioning the country around 8

                                wellness, festivals, sports and adventure and Essence. The Essence of Sri Lanka include
                                what is unique to the country such as its people, art and culture, spices, tea, gems,

                                         text-justify: inter-word;">Since Sri Lanka is a tropical country, you can
                            expect the rain anytime of the year in most parts. However, the two major rainy seasons are
                            North-East monsoon (October to January) and South-West monsoon (May to September). Being an
                            island, the climate of Sri Lanka changes dramatically from one part of the country to
                            another. For example at Nuwara Eliya, in the hills of Central Sri Lanka, has a temperature
                            around -5-20 C throughout the year, whereas Hambanthota, located in the dry zone, has a
                            temperature consistently around 30-35 C.</p>

                            than in the lowlands. At night in the mountains, the temperature can fall below 10 ° C, if
                            you want to visit the mountains, do not forget to warmer clothes (in February I had only
                            shorts and sweatshirt and I was quite cold). The air humidity in Sri Lanka is in the range
                            of 70% to 90%, so the classic Central European after leaving the plane it feels like in the

                            constant temperature and a pleasant 28 ° C; I would just point out that the water in the

                                2000 years! Some of the ancient cities still hold the splendor of these historic
                                monuments and buildings, most having earned the title of world heritage sites. Indians,

                                    <p>Throughout history, Sri Lanka has been known as a land of gems. King Solomon was
                                        said to have procured a great ruby for the Queen of Sheba from Ceylon. Marco
                                        Polo wrote of wonderful Ceylon gems. The Blue Sapphire is king of Sri Lankan
                                        gems. The 400 carat Blue Sapphire called “Blue Belle”, which adorns the British
                                        Crown, is from Sri Lanka. The beautiful star sapphire misnamed the “Star of
                                        India” displayed at a New York’s Museum of Natural History. Besides rubies and
                                        shapphire, the illama soil also bears cat’s eyes, alexandrites, aquamarines,
                                        tourmalines, spinels, topaz, garnets, amethyst, zircons and variety of other
                                        stones. Sri Lanka, the island known as the pearl of the Indian Ocean lives up to

                                    <hr class="departments">
                                    <p>Wood Carving is a form of working wood by means of a cutting tool (knife) in one
                                        hand or a chisel by two hands or with one hand on a chisel and one hand on a
                                        mallet, resulting in a wooden figure or figurine, or in the sculptural
                                        ornamentation of a wooden object. The phrase may also refer to the finished
                                        product, from individual sculptures to hand-worked moldings composing part of a
                                        tracery. The making of sculpture in wood has been extremely widely practiced but
                                        survives much less well than the other main materials such as stone and bronze,
                                        as it is vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire. It therefore forms an
                                        important hidden element in the art history of many cultures.[1] Outdoor wood
                                        sculptures do not last long in most parts of the world, so that we have little
                                        idea how the totem pole tradition developed. Many of the most important
                                        sculptures of China and Japan in particular are in wood, and the great majority
                                        of African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions. Wood is light and
                                        can take very fine detail so it is highly suitable for masks and other sculpture
                                        intended to be worn or carried. It is also much easier to work than stone.</p>

                                    <p>Over the past several decades the Indonesian art of batik making has become
                                        firmly established in Sri Lanka. Batiks incorporate fascinating motifs and
                                        colours, some traditional others highly contemporary and individual, but they
                                        all display a vigorousness of design unique to the island. The material created
                                        by the batik-makers is used to produce distinctive dresses, shirts, sarongs and
                                        beachwear ideal for tropical climes. Many tourists at seaside resorts such as
                                        Hikkaduwa; wear batik clothes throughout their holiday. Apart from clothes;
                                        Handmade Batiks, Table Clothes, Wall Pictures, Beach Clothes, Pure Cotton &
                                        Silk, Mens & Ladies Wears, Bed Covers are popular as a reminder of a visit to
                                        Sri Lanka. The process by which batik is produced consists of the multiple
                                        waxing and dyeing of cloth. First, the desired pattern is drawn on a plain piece
                                        of material. Molten wax is then applied to those areas of the cloth that are not
                                        to be dyed. Next, the material is immersed in the required dye and washed when
                                        the colour has set. If more colours are desired, the process of waxing and
                                        dyeing has to be repeated. Originally when batik making was a cottage industry,
                                        one artist created the entire batik from start to finish.</p>

                                    <p>Masks were an essential feature of Sri Lankan rites and festivities during a time
                                        when people worshipped trees and animals. They are now more of an intriguing
                                        curiosity than they were centuries ago. The traditional mask industry, on the
                                        other hand, is still a booming business that fascinates both locals and visitors
                                        alike. Traditional Sri Lankan masks are usually spotted gracing the walls of
                                        local dwellings, with their colorful facades, strange shapes, and unique
                                        histories. They're also great as a keepsake. All of the masks have ugly traits
                                        that add to their allure. The majority of masks have gaping, deformed lips,
                                        frightening, bulging eyes, and vibrant colors. Local masks can be classified
                                        into numerous groups based on their intended usage.</p>
