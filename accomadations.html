					  text-justify: inter-word;">If you decide to drive by car with driver, then the question of accommodation arises. Everybody can choose and book it either by their own choice (eg booking server booking.com) or use our recommended and verified hotels (we have chosen hotels of middle price category). If you choose accommodation in these hotels, then it is accommodation that the driver arranges, and so he himself has a place to sleep. If you choose to book other hotels, then the driver charges $ 10 per night, which he pays for himself (if there is a hotel reservation below, this does not apply). Recommended hotels are including air conditioning, private bathroom with hot water, WIFI connection and every hotel has a breakfast. The price range of these hotels is from $ 50 to $ 65 / double room. All hotels except Negombo, Trincomalee, Benthota & Hikkaduwa are of the same category and are subject to availability at the time of your reservation. Please take a look at the photos of the hotels below and we will request the capacity of the hotels based on your demand for the circuits and once we have received the confirmation we will send you the links to the hotel you will have at the circuit. </p>

                      <h3>Negombo</h3>
                      <p>In Negombo we offer you a choice of three different hotels. If you want to stay on the beach, then there is a hotel with a pool. This hotel is one of the original in Negombo and therefore you will not find modern room equipment, on the other hand, this hotel is located directly on the beach and in the center of a tourist destination at a very affordable price. This hotel will be used by tourists who spend more than one day in front of the circuit in Negombo. We also offer a brand new hotel, which is close to the airport, and is especially suitable for rest if you arrive in the afternoon or late hours and leave the circuit in the morning. The hotel offers comfortable new rooms, but the hotel has no swimming pool. The last option is the offer of accommodation, which was completed in autumn 2017 and offers cabanas-style accommodation. There are only 4 cabins, so it's especially suitable for those who are looking for peace and relaxation after arrival, but do not require a stay on the beach. The hotel offers a swimming pool and very comfortable room amenities. In case of reservation of the circuit, when you have the offer of Negombo, please write us the hotel you would prefer. </p>

                      <h3>Kandy</h3>
					<p>In the mountain town of Kandy we can offer a hotel on the outskirts of the city in a quiet environment. This hotel is approximately 15 minutes from the city center and 20 minutes from the Royal Botanical Gardens of  Peradeniya . The second option is accommodation in a small hotel, where you will find relaxation in nice rooms. One of the hotels offers the possibility of swimming in the pool, while the other does not. We always demand the first option with a swimming pool, although there is usually no time for swimming in Kandy. Especially if a hotel with a swimming pool is already fully booked, then count on a hotel without a swimming pool. But in Kandy there is usually no room for bathing.</p>

						<p>Right in Dalhousie we can arrange a hotel with a beautiful view of the majestic peak of  Adam's Mountain . As a rule, you arrive in Dalhouise already in the dark, so you can enjoy the panorama of the mountain, especially the next day for breakfast. And good news for all who like to have some beer for dinner. It is the only hotel in the area where alcohol sales are permitted. Dalhousie is a sacred area and you can't buy alcohol anywhere else.
